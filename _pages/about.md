Hi, I'm Joe Tatarka. I am applying to economics PhD programs to start in Fall 2025. I am currently working as a Research Professional at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business working with Professors Chad Syverson and Austan Goolsbee.


## Background and Interests
I graduated from the University of Notre Dame in 2023 with a double major in Mathematics and Economics. While in undergrad I worked for Notre Dame's Wilson Sheehan Lab for Economic Opportunities (LEO) as a research operations intern helping with their mission of estimating the causal effect of poverty interventions using randomized controlled trials. 

I am interested in labor economics and industrial organization.

Hi, I'm Joe Tatarka. I am currently applying to economics PhD programs to start in Fall 2025. I am currently working as a predoc at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business for Professors Chad Syverson and Austan Goolsbee.


## Background and Interests
I graduated from the University of Notre Dame with a B.S. in Mathematics and Economics in 2023. While in undergrad I was a research assistant for Professors A. Nilesh Fernando and Yong Suk Lee. I also worked for Notre Dame's Wilson Sheehan Lab for Economic Opportunities (LEO) as a reserach operations intern helping with their mission of estimating the causal effect of poverty interventions using randomized controlled trials. After I graduated from college I began working as a predoc at Booth.

I am interested in applied microeconomics, particularly labor economics.

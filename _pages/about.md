Hi, I'm Joe Tatarka. In 2025 I started a PhD in Economics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I previously worked as a Research Professional for Chad Syverson and Austan Goolsbee at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business from 2023-2025. I graduated from Notre Dame in 2023 with a double major in Mathematics and Economics.
